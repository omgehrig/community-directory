## City and Country
Zurich, Switzerland
## Background
I have been working in finance (banking) for over a decade, mostly in trading and treasury area. I have been following crypto developments closely and found a keen interest in DeFi which I regard as the way banking & finance is being done in future.
## Why you're excited about Acala, Karura, and DeFi
Having worked for "centralized" finance, I am happy to join the disrupting force of DeFi making finance and banking more inclusive, more efficient and safer for everyone.
## Fun facts and details about yourself
I am a foodie. I love discovering new dishes and recipes, always trying to pair it with the right bottle of wine. Other than that you can see me hiking through the alpes of Switzerland and enjoying nature.
